# Welcome to ASCII Tetris
 
or what I like to call, colorblind-friendly tetris

# IMPORTANT NOTE - YOU MUST HAVE NCURSES INSTALLED ON YOUR TERMINAL IN ORDER FOR IT TO RUN!

## Controls
the controls are very straight forward and displayed on the screen when playing but as a quick reminder,

```
a = move left             d = move right
q = rotate left           e = rotate right
s = move down             space = hard drop
```

Things to still implement:
  - A holding piece option
  - Colors to pieces
